					Slow down on Monday
					Not a sound on Wednesday (yeah)
					Might get loud (ayy) on Friday
					But on Saturday, Saturday, Saturday
					We paint the town
					Lose my sense a time or two
					Weeks feel like days
					Medicate in the afternoon
					And I just want to know
					Have you lost your footing, too?
					I just pray that I'm not losing you
					Catch me floating circles in my fishbowl
					Keep things fresh
					She said that I should change my clothes
					I exaggerate the life we used to know, oh, oh
					Slow down on Monday
					Not a sound on Wednesday (yeah)
					Might get loud (ayy) on Friday
					But on Saturday, Saturday, Saturday
					We paint the town
					Ooh, you're good
					These are my dancing shoes
					We paint the town
					Ooh, you're good
					Thought I would dance with you
					Might get loud (ayy) on Friday
					But on Saturday, Saturday, Saturday
					We paint the town
					Life moves slow on the ocean floor (feeling great)
					I can't feel the waves anymore
					Did the tide forget to move?
					I just pray that I'm not losing you
					Catch me floating circles in my fishbowl
					Keep things fresh
					She said that I should change my clothes
					I exaggerate the life we used to know, oh, yeah
					Working on music?
					Yeah
					I'll just to go to bed, I'm tired
					I wanna watch "Friends" with you
					Oh, if you feel like you have time to do a song or you're inspired
					You should just go for it
					Not a sound on Wednesday
					Might get loud (ayy) on Friday
					But on Saturday, Saturday, Saturday
					We paint the town
					We paint, paint
					Might get loud on Friday
					But on Saturday, Saturday, Saturday</p>
